    "**How it works:**\n",
    "1.  Python retrieves the first item from `magicians` and stores it in the variable `magician`.\n",
    "2.  It executes the indented `print(magician)` line.\n",
    "3.  It repeats this for every item in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "*   **Naming:** Use singular for the variable and plural for the list (e.g., `for cat in cats:`).\n",
    "*   **Indentation:** Indented lines are part of the loop; unindented lines are not."
