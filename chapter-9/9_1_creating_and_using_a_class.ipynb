    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is one of the most effective approaches to writing software. In OOP, you write **classes** that represent real-world things and situations, and you create **objects** based on these classes.\n",

    "When you write a class, you define the general behavior that a whole category of objects can have. When you create individual objects from the class, each object is automatically equipped with the general behavior; you can then give each object whatever unique traits you desire.\n",

You will also learn how to store classes in modules and import classes written by other programmers into your own program files."

Those two pieces of information (name and age) and those two behaviors (sit and roll over) will go into our `Dog` class because they are common to most dogs.",

We’ll pass `Dog()` a name and an age as arguments; `self` is passed automatically, so we don’t need to pass it. Whenever we want to make an instance from the `Dog` class, we’ll provide values for only the last two parameters, `name` and `age`.\n",
