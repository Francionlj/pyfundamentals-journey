    "When creating variable names, it's important to follow a few rules to avoid errors and keep your code understandable:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Allowed Characters:** Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`). They can start with a letter or an underscore, but **not** with a number.\n",
    "    *   **Valid:** `message_1`, `_name`\n",
    "    *   **Invalid:** `1_message`\n",
    "*   **No Spaces:** Spaces are not allowed in variable names. Use underscores to separate words (this is called `snake_case`).\n",
    "    *   **Valid:** `greeting_message`\n",
    "    *   **Invalid:** `greeting message`\n",
    "*   **Avoid Reserved Words:** Do not use Python's keywords (like `print`, `for`, `if`) as variable names, as they have special meanings.\n",
    "*   **Clarity:** Be careful with characters that can be confused, like the lowercase letter `l` and the number `1`, or the uppercase letter `O` and the number `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating good, descriptive variable names is a skill that improves with practice and is crucial for writing complex and maintainable programs."
